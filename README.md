# bAmazon | homework 17

* bAmazon is a CLI app Amazon-like storefront that uses MySQL.

* bAmazon uses MySql and Inquirer NPM packages.
  * [npm i mysql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
  * [npm i inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)

* Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. Then the appm prompt users with two messages. The first will ask for the ID of the product and the second message will ask how many units of the product you would like to buy.
* Once you've placed the order, the app will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
* If not, the app will log an insufficient quantity message, and then prevent the order from going through. If the store does have enough of the product, you should fulfill the customer's order. This means updating the SQL database to reflect the remaining quantity. Once the update goes through, the customer will see the total cost of purchase.
